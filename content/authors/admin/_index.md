**About me**

I am a physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces at [LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/)
in Grenoble (France). In 2022 I received an [MSCA](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) grant (*NanoSep*)
to study the demixing of fluid mixtures by hybrid nanoporous materials, and I am
currently a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher.

**Open source and open data**

All the codes developed as part of my research are shared as open source and available on public repositories, see for instance 
[NMRforMD](https://nmrformd.readthedocs.io), a Python script for calculating hydrogen NMR relaxation rates from molecular dynamics simulations,
or my [Github](https://github.com/simongravelle/) repository containing molecular simulation scripts and data.
In parallel, I have been involved in the development of [MAICoS](https://maicos-devel.gitlab.io/maicos/index.html),
a Python toolkit for analyzing confined molecular simulations.

**Outreach**

In parallel to my research activities, I am developing several outreach projects, including
the [LAMMPS tutorials](https://lammpstutorials.github.io) webpage. 
I also wrote [GROMACS tutorials](https://gromacstutorials.github.io), a
[gallery of animations](https://www.youtube.com/@SimonGravelle), along with creating 
[molecular art](https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/).
